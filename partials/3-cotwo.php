          We know that plastic is a useful material when it comes to keeping your candy safe and tasty. We also know
          that oil-based plastic is from a non-renewable resource, so we started looking to alternatives, which improves
          the CO<sub>2</sub> footprint of the product. That’s when we decided to develop a plastic suitable for candy
          which is partly made from plants.

          This Plant-based plastic actually has the same chemical structure as conventional plastic, so it has the same
          functionality and recyclability, but a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint. The reason why it has a lower
          CO<sub>2</sub> footprint is because more than 35% of the bag is made from sugarcane – pretty sweet (but please
          don't eat it, though)! Who could have thought you could make plastic out of plants, but YES your candy bag is
          partially made from sustainably produced sugarcane.
